Introduction:
-------------
In this project, I conducted a thorough testing process for the EMICalculator website, focusing on multiple financial calculators.
 
 
Description:
------------
The testing was divided into several stages:

Car Loan Calculator Testing: Following the home loan calculator, I tested the Car Loan Calculator webpage. This involved checking the accuracy of EMI calculations for various car loan scenarios and assessing the responsiveness and overall user experience of the interface.

Home Loan Calculator Testing: I began by testing the Home Loan Calculator webpage, verifying the precision of EMI calculations based on different loan amounts, interest rates, and tenures. I also evaluated the user interface to ensure it was intuitive and user-friendly and saved the EMI chart on excel sheet.

Testing Other Calculator Webpages: Finally, I tested additional calculator webpages, including personal loan calculators, education loan calculators, and other financial tools. Each calculator was meticulously tested for accuracy, ease of use, and consistency in delivering reliable results.
